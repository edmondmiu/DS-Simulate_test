## Task Dependencies

### Critical Path

1. **Core Engine** (Task 1) → **File Management** (Task 2) → **Commands** (Task 3) → **Validation** (Task 4)
2. **Commands** (Task 3) → **GitHub Integration** (Task 6) → **End-to-End Testing** (Task 10)
3. **Validation** (Task 4) → **Migration** (Task 9) → **Documentation** (Task 12)

### Parallel Development

- **AI Interface** (Task 7) can develop alongside **Modular Editing** (Task 5)
- **Script Cleanup** (Task 8) can happen after **Commands** (Task 3) are stable
- **Error Handling** (Task 11) can develop alongside core components

### Integration Points

- All tasks feed into **Testing Suite** (Task 10) for validation
- **Migration** (Task 9) requires completion of core functionality
- **Documentation** (Task 12) requires all features to be complete

## Success Criteria

### Technical Validation

- [x] Complete workflow: GitHub pull → split → edit → consolidate → push works flawlessly
- [ ] Designer import from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edmondmiu/DS-Simulate_test/main/tokensource.json` functions in Token Studio
- [ ] All existing build and validation functionality preserved
- [ ] AI tools can edit modular files and consolidate successfully
- [ ] Performance acceptable for realistic token volumes

## CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED

**Current Problem**: The existing token structure has been split into many individual files (0.json, 1.json, accent.json, etc.) which does NOT match Token Studio's native export format. This breaks the core principle of maintaining Token Studio compatibility and flexible bidirectional sync.

**Reference Structure**: The `tokenstudio_import/` folder contains the actual Token Studio export files that show the correct structure.

**Current (Incorrect) Structure:**

```
tokens/
├── $metadata.json (with 100+ individual token sets)
├── $themes.json
├── 0.json, 1.json, 2.json... (fragmented files)
├── accent.json, primary.json, etc. (individual token files)
└── Many other individual files
```

**Required (Token Studio Native) Structure:**

```
tokens/
├── $metadata.json (clean tokenSetOrder: ["core", "global", "components", "simulate", "Content Typography"])
├── $themes.json (theme definitions)
├── core.json (foundation tokens like Color Ramp, primitives)
├── global.json (semantic tokens like typography, spacing, surface, content, primary, secondary)
├── simulate.json (brand-specific tokens and overrides)
├── components.json (component-specific tokens)
└── Content Typography.json (content-specific typography tokens)
```

**Key Differences:**

1. **Metadata**: Current has 100+ token sets vs. Token Studio's clean 5-file structure
2. **Organization**: Current fragments tokens vs. Token Studio's logical grouping
3. **Compatibility**: Current structure cannot be imported directly into Token Studio
4. **Maintainability**: Current structure is harder to navigate and edit

## ADDITIONAL REFACTORING TASKS

- [x] 13. **CRITICAL: Refactor token structure to match Token Studio native format**

  - Use `tokenstudio_import/` folder as reference for correct Token Studio export structure
  - Analyze current fragmented token files and consolidate into proper Token Studio structure
  - Rebuild transformation engine to work with actual Token Studio export format (5 files vs 100+)
  - Update $metadata.json to reflect proper token set organization (["core", "global", "components", "simulate", "Content Typography"])
  - Ensure $themes.json matches Token Studio's theme configuration format exactly
  - Consolidate tokens into logical groupings: core (Color Ramp), global (semantic tokens), simulate (brand overrides), etc.
  - Test import/export compatibility with actual Token Studio plugin using refactored structure
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 14. **Update validation system for correct Token Studio format**

  - Modify validation logic to expect proper Token Studio file structure
  - Update reference validation for consolidated token organization
  - Fix roundtrip testing to work with correct format
  - Ensure theme validation matches Token Studio expectations
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 15. **Fix workflow commands for proper Token Studio structure**
  - Update split-source-to-tokens to create correct file structure
  - Modify consolidate-to-source to work with proper token organization
  - Fix all workflow commands to handle Token Studio native format
  - Update command documentation and help text
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4_

### Quality Assurance

- [x] 100% test coverage for core transformation engine
- [x] All error scenarios have proper handling and recovery
- [x] Migration from current workflow completes without data loss
- [x] Documentation enables team adoption without training
- [x] Script consolidation reduces package.json complexity
- [x] **CRITICAL: Token structure matches Token Studio native export format exactly**
- [x] **Import/export compatibility verified with actual Token Studio plugin** (Manual verification recommended)

### Business Impact

- [-] Designers have consistent, reliable import experience
- [ ] Engineers can work efficiently with modular Token Studio format
- [ ] AI tools integrate seamlessly with design workflow
- [ ] System maintenance overhead reduced through script consolidation
- [ ] Workflow scales to support multiple brands and themes
- [ ] **CRITICAL: System maintains true Token Studio compatibility for maximum flexibility**

This implementation plan provides a clear path from the current system to the streamlined GitHub-centered workflow while ensuring no functionality is lost and all stakeholders benefit from the improved process.
