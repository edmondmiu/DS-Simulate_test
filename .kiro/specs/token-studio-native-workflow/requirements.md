# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a bidirectional workflow system that uses Token Studio's native export format as the primary working structure for design system engineers and AI tools, while maintaining tokensource.json as the single source of truth. The system enables seamless collaboration between Figma designers using Token Studio and engineers/AI tools working with modular token files.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Source Splitting for Modular Editing

**User Story:** As a design system engineer, I want to split the canonical tokensource.json into Token Studio's modular format, so that I can work with the latest design system state in an AI-friendly structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN splitting tokensource.json THEN the system SHALL create Token Studio's native file structure including $metadata.json, $themes.json, and individual token set files
2. WHEN splitting the source THEN the system SHALL preserve all token references, metadata, and theme configurations
3. WHEN splitting the source THEN the system SHALL maintain Token Studio's expected syntax and structure
4. IF splitting fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating structural issues in the source
5. WHEN splitting is successful THEN the system SHALL update the tokens/ folder with the current modular structure

### Requirement 2: Modular Token Editing Support

**User Story:** As a design system engineer, I want to edit tokens in Token Studio's native modular format, so that I can make precise changes without dealing with complex monolithic files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working with imported tokens THEN the system SHALL maintain Token Studio's file structure ($metadata.json, $themes.json, core.json, global.json, etc.)
2. WHEN editing individual token files THEN the system SHALL preserve token references and relationships
3. WHEN making changes to modular files THEN the system SHALL validate token syntax and references
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages with file and line information
5. WHEN changes are complete THEN the system SHALL allow consolidation back to single source of truth

### Requirement 3: Consolidation to Single Source of Truth

**User Story:** As a design system engineer, I want to consolidate modular token changes back into tokensource.json, so that I maintain a single source of truth for the design system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN consolidating modular changes THEN the system SHALL merge all token files into a single tokensource.json structure
2. WHEN consolidating THEN the system SHALL resolve all token references and maintain semantic relationships
3. WHEN consolidating THEN the system SHALL preserve all metadata, descriptions, and theme configurations
4. WHEN consolidation is complete THEN the system SHALL validate the resulting tokensource.json for completeness and correctness
5. IF consolidation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error reporting with specific file and token information

### Requirement 4: Designer Integration via Single Source

**User Story:** As a Figma designer, I want to import the latest design tokens from a single, consistent GitHub URL, so that I always have access to the current design system without coordinating file exports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designers import tokens THEN the system SHALL provide tokensource.json as the canonical import source
2. WHEN tokensource.json is accessed THEN the system SHALL ensure it contains the latest consolidated changes from engineering
3. WHEN designers import from the source THEN Token Studio SHALL properly parse the structure and enable theme switching
4. WHEN the source is updated THEN designers SHALL be able to re-import to get the latest changes
5. WHEN import is successful THEN designers SHALL have access to all themes, tokens, and metadata

### Requirement 5: Bidirectional Sync Validation

**User Story:** As a design system engineer, I want to validate that changes can flow in both directions without data loss, so that I can ensure the workflow maintains design system integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing bidirectional sync THEN the system SHALL validate that Token Studio export → consolidation → export produces equivalent results
2. WHEN validating sync THEN the system SHALL check that all tokens, references, and metadata are preserved
3. WHEN validating sync THEN the system SHALL verify theme configurations remain intact
4. WHEN validation detects discrepancies THEN the system SHALL report specific differences with actionable recommendations
5. WHEN sync validation passes THEN the system SHALL confirm the workflow is ready for production use

### Requirement 6: AI-Friendly Editing Interface

**User Story:** As an AI tool, I want to edit tokens in the modular Token Studio format, so that I can make programmatic changes that integrate seamlessly with the designer workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI tools access modular tokens THEN the system SHALL provide clear file structure documentation
2. WHEN AI tools edit token files THEN the system SHALL validate changes in real-time
3. WHEN AI tools complete edits THEN the system SHALL support automatic consolidation workflows
4. WHEN AI edits are consolidated THEN the system SHALL maintain all human-readable descriptions and metadata
5. WHEN AI workflow is complete THEN the system SHALL ensure changes are ready for designer import

### Requirement 7: Workflow Command Interface

**User Story:** As a design system engineer, I want simple commands to manage the GitHub-centered workflow, so that I can efficiently work with modular tokens while maintaining the single source of truth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using workflow commands THEN the system SHALL provide `split-source-to-tokens` command for creating modular editing structure
2. WHEN using workflow commands THEN the system SHALL provide `consolidate-to-source` command for updating the canonical source
3. WHEN using workflow commands THEN the system SHALL provide `sync-from-github` command for getting latest changes before editing
4. WHEN using workflow commands THEN the system SHALL provide `validate-workflow-integrity` command for testing the complete workflow
5. WHEN commands execute THEN the system SHALL provide clear progress feedback and error reporting

### Requirement 8: Script Consolidation and Cleanup

**User Story:** As a design system engineer, I want a lean, focused set of scripts that support the new workflow, so that I can maintain the system efficiently without script bloat.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing new workflow THEN the system SHALL consolidate redundant scripts into streamlined commands
2. WHEN updating scripts THEN the system SHALL preserve essential functionality (validation, build, publish)
3. WHEN updating scripts THEN the system SHALL replace old bidirectional sync scripts with new GitHub-centered workflow scripts
4. WHEN script cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL have clear, purpose-driven commands without duplication
5. WHEN new scripts are implemented THEN the system SHALL maintain existing Style Dictionary integration and build processes

### Requirement 9: Migration and Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a design system engineer, I want to migrate smoothly from the current workflow to the new one, so that I can adopt the improved process without disrupting ongoing work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating workflows THEN the system SHALL maintain tokensource.json as the canonical source
2. WHEN migrating THEN the system SHALL provide clear migration documentation and steps
3. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL validate that all existing functionality still works
4. IF migration issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capability to previous workflow
5. WHEN migration is successful THEN the system SHALL remove obsolete scripts and documentation
