- **Designer URL**: Generates correct GitHub raw URL for designer import

### 2. Split (split-source-to-tokens) ✅
- **Command**: `npm run split-source-to-tokens`
- **Status**: WORKING
- **Evidence**: Successfully converts `tokensource.json` to Token Studio modular format
- **Files Created**: 
  - `$metadata.json` ✅
  - `$themes.json` ✅
  - Individual token set files (100+ files) ✅
- **Structure**: Proper Token Studio format maintained

### 3. Edit (modular token editing) ✅
- **Capability**: Direct editing of modular Token Studio files
- **Status**: WORKING
- **Evidence**: 
  - Files can be edited directly in `tokens/` directory
  - Token Studio native format preserved
  - AI-friendly structure maintained
  - Real-time validation available

### 4. Consolidate (consolidate-to-source) ✅
- **Command**: `npm run consolidate-to-source`
- **Status**: WORKING (with known metadata sync issue)
- **Evidence**: Successfully merges modular files back to `tokensource.json`
- **Backup**: Creates automatic backups before consolidation
- **Validation**: Validates consolidated output

### 5. Push (designer import readiness) ✅
- **Command**: `npm run test-designer-import`
- **Status**: WORKING
- **Evidence**: Generates correct GitHub raw URL for Token Studio import
- **URL Format**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edmondmiu/DS-Simulate_test/main/tokensource.json`
- **Accessibility**: Public repository allows direct designer access
